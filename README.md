### Hi there 👋

We are going to host a web to show the blacklist of unscrupulous medical institution. We hope the web could help people keep away from unscrupulous medical institution and avoid unnecessary medical expense and misdiagnosis.
我们将会建立一个网站，专门用来显示无良医疗机构的黑名单。我们希望这个网站能够帮助人们远离不良医疗机构，避免不必要的医疗支出和误诊。
